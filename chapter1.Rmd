# About the project

*This course is to give the understanding of open data, open science, and open research tools.*

# First exercise{#alku}

I am feeling `confused` and a bit *stressed*. But also **excited** as well. 

My expectations are:

- learn the tools
- learn to analyse and use statistics
- refresh my old knowledge 
- understand the possibilites of open data & tools


Then just a couple of lists to learn to make the lists:

* Item 1
  + Item 1.1
  + Item 1.2
    - Item 1.2.1

1. Item
    i) Item
    ii) Item
          a. Item

    
I heard from this course from my colleague.
